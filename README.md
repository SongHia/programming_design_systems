# programming_design_systems
===============================
ABOUT THE CLASS  
Programming Design Systems is a graduate course focused on the intersection between graphic design and code. Class time is divided between design topics like color, grid systems, and typography, and more computational topics like randomization, repetition, transformation and generative form. The students work to write software that abstract these design theories into code, and print the output on paper for design critique.  

These samples use the <a href="http://runemadsen.github.io/rune.js/">Rune.js library.</a>
